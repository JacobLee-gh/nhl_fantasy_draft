# nhl_fantasy_draft
This will be used to run a streamlit app that allows a user to input specific point values for each category in their league and pull last years player stats and give total fantasy points for each player.  This will help decide who to draft on draft day.

# original data location
csv files were pulled down from dailyfaceoff.com

# Install the dependencies
```bash
uv sync
```


# Use this to run python code to Streamlit App
```bash
uv run streamlit run main.py
```
