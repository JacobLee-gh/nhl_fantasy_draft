# nhl_fantasy_draft
This will be used to run a streamlit app that allows a user to input specific point values for each category in their league and pull last years player stats and give total fantasy points for each player.  This will help decide who to draft on draft day.





# Use this to run python code to Streamlit App
uv run streamlit run main.py
